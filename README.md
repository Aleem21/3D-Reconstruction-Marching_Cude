Csci 5561 -- Computer Vision

Project: 3D Reconstruction of Lego Houses Based on Multiple-view Stereo Images

How to run code:
Run main.m by Matlab

Note that default surface reconstruction resolution is set to be 256x256x64. To chanage the resolution, modify the paramters at
surf_recon(256, 64);

Result:
The program will finally create a .ply file called dart.ply in the output directory. It is the trigular surface file and can be visualized in Meshlab.
